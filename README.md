# ClickThroughRatePrediction
Build click-through rate prediction model from Avuzu data using Machine Learning models in Apache Spark.

### Objectives:
The main research objectives are to and better ways to handle the huge amounts of data that is available and thereby suggest better methods to analyze it. This is done by comparison of results obtained by various machine learning tools and techniques. Different models are generated to predict the click-through rate in order to achieve a higher success percentage.
* Build a Binary Classifcation model to predict the click through rate using all the
features available in the dataset.
* In order to accommodate Big Data and Streaming data, implementation in suitable
frameworks.
* Determine the algorithm which performs the best according to chosen evaluation
metrics.
